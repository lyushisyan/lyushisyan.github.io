intro: >
  I am currently a Ph.D. candidate and <strong>Assistant</strong> at Bauman Moscow State Technical University. 
  <br><br>
  My research focuses on <strong>heat conduction at micro- and nanoscale</strong>, combining <strong>numerical computational methods</strong> with theoretical analysis to explore phonon transport in complex systems.
  <br><br>
  To date, I have published <strong>8 SCI papers</strong> with over <strong>%CITATIONS% citations</strong> and an <strong>H-index of 4</strong>. My work aims to bridge the gap between microscopic physical mechanisms and macroscopic thermal engineering applications.
