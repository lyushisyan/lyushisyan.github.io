I am dedicated to teaching graduate-level courses that integrate fundamental physics with advanced computational tools. 

Currently, I serve as an instructor for courses on **Numerical Simulation Methods** and **Thermal Physics of Nanosystems**. These courses are designed to equip Master's students with the skills to apply Python, Machine Learning, and Ab Initio methods (DFT/MD) to solve complex thermophysical problems.
