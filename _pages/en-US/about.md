**Research Interests:**  
My research focuses on **thermal transport at the micro- and nanoscale**, with particular emphasis on phonon transport mechanisms in low-dimensional materials.

**Main Research Topics:**  
- Phonon confinement effects  
- Resonant hybridization phenomena  
- Targeted phonon excitation mechanisms  
- First-principles calculations  
- Monte Carlo simulations  
- Machine learning for thermal transport modeling
