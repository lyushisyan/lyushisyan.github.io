In solids, the main carriers of heat are phonons. For decades, researchers have proposed two classic theories to explain phonon heat transport in different kinds of materials:

- **In crystals**, phonons behave like little particles that fly and scatter, and heat conduction is described by the **Peierls–Boltzmann Equation (BTE)**.  
- **In glasses**, phonons lose their “particle-like” character, vibrational modes become localized, and heat flow proceeds via **coherent tunneling diffusion between different modes**. This is the physical picture behind the **Allen–Feldman (AF) equation**.  

However, in realistic complex materials, **particle-like and wave-like mechanisms often coexist**. Traditional BTE and AF models each apply only to one extreme limit and lack a unified description.  
The **Wigner Transport Equation (WTE)** was introduced precisely to place both limits into a single quantum phase–space framework, thereby providing a unified description.

## Peierls–Boltzmann Equation

> BTE: Phonons propagate like little particles  

Applicable systems: long-range ordered crystals with well-separated phonon bands and clearly defined modes.

Phonons can be viewed as localized wave packets, like little particles flying through space with a well-defined group velocity, undergoing scattering during their propagation.

Linearized BTE:

$$
  \partial_t f_{\mathbf q s} + \mathbf v_{\mathbf q s}\cdot\nabla_{\mathbf r} f_{\mathbf q s}
  = -\frac{f_{\mathbf q s} - f^{\text{eq}}_{\mathbf q s}}{\tau_{\mathbf q s}}
$$

- $f_{\mathbf q s}$: phonon occupation function  
- $\mathbf v_{\mathbf q s} = \nabla_{\mathbf q}\omega_{\mathbf q s}$: group velocity  
- $\tau_{\mathbf q s}$: relaxation time  

**Thermal conductivity in RTA form**:
 
$$
\kappa_{\alpha\beta}^{\mathrm{BTE}}
= \frac{1}{V}\sum_{\mathbf q s}
C_{\mathbf q s}\, v_{\mathbf q s,\alpha}\, v_{\mathbf q s,\beta}\, \tau_{\mathbf q s},
$$

## Allen–Feldman Equation

> AF: Energy is no longer carried by “flying particles”, but transferred by one “tuning fork” driving another into resonance.

Applicable systems: glasses and disordered solids.

In glasses, vibrational modes are highly localized and possess almost no effective group velocity. Energy is not transported via “phonon particles” but instead diffuses through **tunneling/resonant coupling between different localized states**:

- Energy spacing between vibrational states is extremely small (quasi-degenerate), allowing mutual coupling.  
- This can be likened to “a row of tuning forks”: when frequencies are close, striking one tuning fork can drive the neighboring ones, and energy is passed along step by step.  

**Mathematical expression**:

$$
  \kappa_{\text{AF}} = \frac{\pi}{V} \sum_{i\neq j} (n_i - n_j)\, 
  |\langle i | \hat v | j \rangle|^2 \, \delta(\omega_i - \omega_j)
$$ 

- $\hat v$: heat current (velocity) operator  
- $\delta(\omega_i - \omega_j)$: energy conservation; only quasi-degenerate states can couple to each other  

## Wigner Transport Equation

> WTE: The “director” that puts both “particles” and “tuning forks” on the same stage  

Starting from the quantum mechanical **one-body density matrix** and performing a **Wigner transformation**, one obtains a distribution function in phase space (momentum $\mathbf q$ and real space $\mathbf R$):

$$
    n_{s,s'}(\mathbf q, \mathbf R, t)
$$

**Diagonal elements ($s=s'$)**: populations, corresponding to particle-like mechanisms, similar to BTE.  
**Off-diagonal elements ($s\neq s'$)**: coherences, corresponding to wave-like mechanisms, similar to AF.  

**The unique feature of WTE is that it tracks not only the number of phonons, but also the coherence between different phonon states.**

The general form of WTE is:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} n_{s,s'} + i(\omega_{\mathbf q s}-\omega_{\mathbf q s'})\,n_{s,s'} + \tfrac{1}{2}\{\mathbf v(\mathbf q), \nabla_{\mathbf R} n\}_{s,s'} = \left.\frac{\partial n}{\partial t}\right|_{\text{scatt}}
$$  

where  
- First term: time evolution (dynamical change)  
- Second term: coherent oscillation (wave-like mechanism)  
- Third term: drift term (particle transport)  
- Right-hand side: scattering term (anharmonic effects)

In the **crystalline limit**: band separations are large ($\Delta \omega \gg 1/\tau$), coherence terms oscillate rapidly and average out, and WTE → BTE.

In the **glassy limit**: modes are quasi-degenerate ($\Delta \omega \ll 1/\tau$), the particle term becomes ineffective, and WTE → AF.

In **complex crystals / intermediate regimes**: $\Delta \omega \sim 1/\tau$, particle and wave contributions are inseparable, and WTE yields

$$
\kappa = \kappa_P + \kappa_C
$$  

- **Particle term (populations)**: under weak interband-coupling approximation, it can be written in a form similar to BTE:

  $$
  \kappa_{\alpha\beta}^{P}
  \simeq \frac{1}{V}\sum_{\mathbf q s}
  C_{\mathbf q s}\, v_{\mathbf q s,\alpha}\, v_{\mathbf q s,\beta}\, \tilde{\tau}_{\mathbf q s},
  $$

  where $\tilde{\tau}_{\mathbf q s}\approx \big(2\Gamma_{\mathbf q s}\big)^{-1}$ is related to the spectral linewidth $\Gamma_{\mathbf q s}$ (arising from anharmonicity, isotope scattering, etc.), reflecting a spectroscopic correction to the “particle lifetime” in WTE.

- **Coherent term (coherences)**: characterizes wave-like coupling/tunneling between quasi-degenerate modes. A commonly used Lorentzian-type expression in the frequency domain can be written as
  
  $$
  \kappa_{\alpha\beta}^{C}
  \simeq \frac{1}{V}\sum_{\mathbf q}\!\!\sum_{s\neq s'}
  \frac{\big[\hbar(\omega_{\mathbf q s}+\omega_{\mathbf q s'})/2\big]\,
        \partial_T n^{\mathrm{eq}}_{\bar{\omega}}}
       {(\omega_{\mathbf q s}-\omega_{\mathbf q s'})^{2}
        +(\Gamma_{\mathbf q s}+\Gamma_{\mathbf q s'})^{2}}\,
  (v_{\alpha})_{s s'}(v_{\beta})_{s' s}\,
  \big(\Gamma_{\mathbf q s}+\Gamma_{\mathbf q s'}\big),
  $$
  
  where $(v_{\alpha})_{ss'}$ denotes the **off-diagonal elements** of the velocity operator in the mode basis (determining the strength of coherent coupling), $\bar{\omega}$ is an appropriate average of the two mode frequencies, and $\Gamma$ controls the width associated with decoherence/dephasing.

This expression highlights that **smaller band separations between modes, larger off-diagonal velocity matrix elements, and moderate linewidths all enhance coherent heat transport**.

## Relations and Unification of the Three Theories  

- **BTE limit**: When band separations are much larger than linewidths, coherent effects can be neglected and WTE automatically reduces to BTE.  
- **AF limit**: In the strongly disordered limit, WTE reduces to the AF equation.  
- **Complex crystals and intermediate regimes**: When band spacings are comparable to phonon linewidths, neither BTE nor AF is sufficient. WTE simultaneously captures contributions from populations and coherent states and yields the full thermal conductivity.  

**Thus, WTE is not only a mathematical unification but also a physical bridge between these pictures.**
