The calculations handled by `pw.x` include seven types, specified in the input file with `calculation`:

- `'scf'`: Self-consistent field (SCF) calculation, solving the differential-integral Kohn-Sham equations iteratively. Convergence is achieved when the change in charge density is small enough, resulting in self-consistent charge.
- `'nscf'`: Non-self-consistent calculation, usually performed on a denser k-space grid for integrations like DOS. Uses self-consistent charge and computes properties for additional k-points.
- `'bands'`: Another non-self-consistent calculation where k-points follow specific paths in 3D k-space.
- `'relax'`: A series of SCF calculations for ionic relaxation based on Hellman-Feynman forces, optimizing atomic coordinates to minimize forces while keeping the cell fixed.
- `'vc-relax'`: Similar to relax but allows the cell to vary based on stress calculations.
- `'md'`: Molecular dynamics simulation, treating the ion-electron interaction as a potential for ionic motion and solving the classical equations of motion for ions.
- `'vc-md'`: Molecular dynamics with cell variation.

## Input File

In QE input files, there are `NAMELISTS` and `INPUT_CARDS`.

`PWscf` requires three mandatory `NAMELISTS`:

1. `&CONTROL`: Specifies the calculation flow.
2. `&SYSTEM`: Describes the system.
3. `&ELECTRONS`: Defines the algorithm for solving the Kohn-Sham equations.

Two additional `NAMELISTS`, `&IONS` and `&CELLS`, are needed for specific calculations.

The three mandatory `INPUT_CARDS` in `PWscf` are `ATOMIC_SPECIES`, `ATOMIC_POSITIONS`, and `K_POINTS`. Other information may be required depending on the calculation.

### Example: Self-Consistent Calculation for Silicon (`pw.scf.silicon.in`)

```bash
&CONTROL
calculation='scf',   # Self-consistent field calculation
prefix='silicon',   # Prefix for output files
pseudo_dir='./pseudo/',   # Directory for pseudopotentials
outdir='./out/',   # Directory for output files
/
&SYSTEM
ibrav=2,   # Bravais lattice type (FCC)
celldm(1)=10.2625,   # Lattice constant (in Bohr, 1 Bohr = 0.529 Å)
nat=2,   # Number of atoms
ntyp=1,   # Number of atomic types
ecutwfc=60.0,   # Wavefunction cutoff energy (in Ry, 1 Ry = 13.606 eV)
ecutrho=720.0,   # Charge density cutoff energy
/
&ELECTRONS
mixing_beta=0.7,   # Mixing ratio for charge density (default 0.7)
conv_thr=1d-8,   # Convergence threshold for SCF (default 1d-6)
/
ATOMIC_SPECIES
Si 28.0855 Si.pbe-rrkj.UPF   # Pseudopotential
ATOMIC_POSITIONS (alat)   # Atomic positions (alat = lattice parameter)
Si 0.00 0.00 0.00
Si 0.25 0.25 0.25
K_POINTS automatic  # Automatic k-point grid
4 4 4 1 1 1
```

- `ibrav`: Values from 1–14 correspond to the 14 Bravais lattices; 0 for free lattice.
- `ecutwfc`: Suggested value depends on the pseudopotential used.
- `ecutrho`: Related to `ecutwfc`:
  - For NC pseudopotentials, this is 4× `ecutwfc`.
  - For US pseudopotentials, this is 8–12× `ecutwfc`.
  - For PAW pseudopotentials, this is 4× `ecutwfc`.
- File saved as `pw.scf.silicon.in`.
- Suggested settings: `occupations='smearing', smearing='gaussian', degauss=1d-9` for Gaussian smearing.

Refer to the [**PWscf User Manual**](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/INPUT_PW.html) for a detailed explanation.

## Execution

```bash
mpirun -np 4 pw.x -inp pw.scf.silicon.in > pw.scf.silicon.out
```

## Output File

Check the output file `pw.scf.silicon.out` for convergence details:

```bash
grep -e 'total energy' -e estimate pw.scf.silicon.out
```

End of self-consistent calculation
```

Important notes:
- The **total energy** depends on the selected pseudopotential.
- Convergence is achieved in 6 iterations.

```json
!    total energy              =     -15.83900302 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.2E-10 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:
     one-electron contribution =       4.79863652 Ry
     hartree contribution      =       1.07565897 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -4.81353993 Ry
     ewald contribution        =     -16.89975858 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in   6 iterations
```

### Tips

- Reduce `mixing_beta` for oscillating convergence.
- Increase cutoff energies (`ecutwfc`, `ecutrho`).
- Use recommended pseudopotentials.
- Suggested `conv_thr` values:
  - Energy and eigenvalues (SCF): 1.0d-7 Ry.
  - Forces (relax): 1.0e-8 Ry.
  - Stress (vc-relax): 1.0d-9 Ry.
