## 1. Input Files
The input files for VASP are the four basic files: `INCAR`, `POSCAR`, `POTCAR`, `KPOINTS`.

### 1.1 `INCAR` Parameter Settings

```

For structural optimization, key parameters in `INCAR` include `IBRION`, `ISIF`, `NSW`, `EDIFF`, and `EDIFFG`.

#### 1.1.1 Common `IBRION` Settings and Applications

##### (1) Single-Point Energy Calculation
- **`IBRION = -1`**  
**Usage**: Used for single-point energy calculations such as fixed lattice, electronic structure, or DOS analysis.  
**Note**: Avoid setting `NSW > 0` to prevent wasting resources.

##### (2) Structure Optimization
- **`IBRION = 1`** (RMM-DIIS)  
**Usage**: Suitable for smooth potential energy surfaces in simple systems.  
**Limitation**: May encounter convergence issues for complex or unstable surfaces.

- **`IBRION = 2`** (Conjugate Gradient)  
**Usage**: Most commonly used method, suitable for most systems.  
**Advantage**: Performs well for steep and complex surfaces.

- **`IBRION = 3`** (Damped Molecular Dynamics)  
**Usage**: Stabilizes optimization paths that oscillate or diverge.

##### (3) Molecular Dynamics
- **`IBRION = 0`**  
**Usage**: For studying dynamic behavior of systems at different temperatures, such as diffusion or vibrational modes.

##### (4) Phonon Calculations

a. **Finite Difference Method** **`IBRION = 5, 6`**  
Calculates phonon modes using finite difference:
- **`5`**: Without symmetry, suitable for defective or low-symmetry structures.
- **`6`**: Exploits symmetry for efficient calculations in high-symmetry systems.

b. **Perturbation Theory (DFPT)** **`IBRION = 7, 8`**  
Calculates phonon modes using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT):
- **`7`**: Without symmetry optimization, suitable for low-symmetry structures.
- **`8`**: Utilizes symmetry for faster computation.

#### 1.1.2 Common `ISIF` Settings and Applications

- Default value (if not set): `ISIF = 2` (Optimize atomic positions only, keep lattice shape and volume fixed).

- Special Cases:
  - `IBRION = 0` (molecular dynamics) or `LHFCALC = .TRUE.` (hybrid functional): `ISIF = 0`.

- **`ISIF = 2` (Most Common)**  
Optimizes atomic positions only, suitable for 2D materials, fixed lattice constants, or surface/interface systems.

- **`ISIF = 3` (Bulk Optimization)**  
Optimizes atomic positions, lattice shape, and volume, suitable for bulk material relaxations.

- **`ISIF = 4` (Fixed Volume Optimization)**  
Optimizes atomic positions and lattice shape while keeping the volume fixed, useful for pressure tests.

- **`ISIF = 6` (Lattice-Only Optimization)**  
Optimizes lattice shape and volume without relaxing atomic positions, useful for testing lattice parameters.

- **`ISIF = 0` (Position Optimization, No Stress Calculation)**  
Optimizes atomic positions without calculating stress, for fixed cell optimizations.

#### 1.1.3 Recommended Settings for `NSW`, `EDIFF`, and `EDIFFG`

| Parameter | Function                       | Initial Optimization | High-Precision Optimization | Single Point |

```

### 1.3 KPOINTS File

#### (1) Monkhorst-Pack Grid
Monkhorst-Pack grids provide a uniform k-point distribution for periodic crystal calculations.

```bash
Automatic k-point generation   # Automatic k-point generation method (comment)
0                              # Ignore total k-point count, use automatic generation
Monkhorst-Pack                 # Choose Monkhorst-Pack grid
4 4 4                          # Grid density in x, y, z directions
0 0 0                          # No grid shift
```

**Use Case:** Periodic crystals, optimization, DOS calculations, and electronic structure analysis.

#### (2) Gamma Grid
Gamma grids center the k-point grid at the Gamma point, suitable for small or asymmetric lattices.

```bash
Automatic k-point generation   # Automatic k-point generation method (comment)
0                              # Ignore total k-point count, use automatic generation
Gamma                          # Choose Gamma-centered grid
4 4 4                          # Grid density in x, y, z directions
0 0 0                          # No grid shift
```

**Use Case:** Small systems, asymmetric lattices, or fast calculation optimization tasks.

### 1.4 POTCAR File Usage

POTCAR contains pseudopotential information required to describe atomic properties in the system.

#### VASP Provides Multiple Types of Pseudopotentials:
- **POT_GGA_PAW:** PAW pseudopotentials with GGA functional.
- **POT_LDA_PAW:** PAW pseudopotentials with LDA functional.

#### Generating the POTCAR File:
For a system with atoms like Si and H, concatenate the pseudopotential files:

```bash
cat /POT_GGA_PAW/POTCAR_Si /POT_GGA_PAW/POTCAR_H > POTCAR
```

- Ensure the functional type in POTCAR matches the INCAR settings.
- Maintain the atom order in POTCAR consistent with the element order in POSCAR.

## 3. Optimization Process and Convergence Criteria

### 3.1 Optimization Process

1. **Initialization of the Structure:**
   - The initial structure is provided through the `POSCAR` file.
   - The optimization conditions are configured using the `POTCAR`, `KPOINTS`, and `INCAR` files.

2. **Stepwise Optimization:**
   - After each ionic optimization step, the total energy, atomic forces, and lattice stress of the system are recalculated.
   - The optimization continues until convergence criteria (e.g., `EDIFFG`) are satisfied or the maximum number of steps (`NSW`) is reached.

3. **Structure Updates:**
   - Intermediate results of each optimization step are stored in the `XDATCAR` file.
   - The final structure after optimization is saved in the `CONTCAR` file.

### 3.2 Convergence Criteria

The convergence of the optimization process can be determined using the following methods:

1. **`OUTCAR` File:**
   - Check whether the force on each atom is less than |`EDIFFG`|.
   - Verify whether the total energy change is less than `EDIFF`.

2. **`OSZICAR` File:**
   - Review the energy changes (`E0` and `dE`) during the SCF iterations.
   - Determine whether the SCF process has stabilized and converged.

3. **`CONTCAR` File:**
   - Extract the final optimized atomic positions and lattice parameters.
   - If the optimization has not converged, the `CONTCAR` file contains the structure from the last step.

4. **Using Tools:**
   - Use tools like `pymatgen` or `ASE` to parse the `vasprun.xml` file and evaluate convergence.

### 3.3 Common Issues and Solutions

#### **3.3.1 SCF Not Converging**

**Issue:** SCF iterations show energy oscillations or divergence.

**Possible Causes:**
- The initial electronic density is poorly set.
- Insufficient cutoff energy (`ENCUT`).

**Solutions:**
- Increase the maximum number of SCF iterations by setting `NELM=200`.
- Raise the cutoff energy: increase `ENCUT` to 520 eV or higher.

#### **3.3.2 Optimization Not Converging**

**Issue:** Optimization reaches the maximum steps (`NSW`) but does not meet convergence criteria for force or energy.

**Possible Causes:**
- The initial structure is far from the energy minimum.
- Convergence criteria (`EDIFFG`) are too strict.
- The optimization step size (`POTIM`) is too large.

**Solutions:**
- Provide a reasonable initial structure or pre-optimize using external tools.
- Relax the convergence criteria: adjust `EDIFFG` from `-0.01` to `-0.02`.
- Reduce the optimization step size: adjust `POTIM` from `0.5` to `0.2`.

#### **3.3.3 Oscillations During Optimization**

**Issue:** Energy and forces oscillate repeatedly during optimization, preventing stable convergence.

**Possible Causes:**
- The optimization step size (`POTIM`) is too large.
- The optimization algorithm is unsuitable for the system.

**Solutions:**
- Decrease the optimization step size: set `POTIM` to `0.2` or smaller.
- Change the optimization algorithm:
  - Use the conjugate gradient method by setting `IBRION=2`.
  - Use damped molecular dynamics by setting `IBRION=3`.

#### **3.3.4 Divergence During Optimization**

**Issue:** Severe deformation of the structure occurs during optimization, leading to significant energy increases.

**Possible Causes:**
- Atomic distances are too short due to an unreasonable initial structure.
- Inadequate vacuum spacing (for low-dimensional systems such as thin films or nanostructures).
- Incorrect pseudopotential files.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure reasonable initial atomic distances to avoid overly close atoms.
- Increase the vacuum spacing: for low-dimensional systems, set the vacuum layer thickness to at least 15 Å.
- Verify the `POTCAR` file to ensure the pseudopotential matches the atomic species.
