Setting Boundary Conditions</h2> <p>In phonon transport problems, various types of boundary conditions can arise: adiabatic boundaries, isothermal boundaries, and periodic boundaries.</p> <h3 id="31-adiabatic-boundary">3.1 Adiabatic Boundary</h3> <p>Adiabatic boundaries reflect all incident phonons. This reflection process can be divided into two main categories: diffuse reflection and specular reflection.</p> <p>In both cases, it is assumed that the polarization and frequency of phonons remain unchanged upon reflection. The only parameter modified during this process is the direction of propagation.</p> <p>(i) Specular reflection ensures energy conservation, \(e^d(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol k) = e^d(\boldsymbol x, \boldsymbol k')\), with the direction given by: \(\boldsymbol k' = \boldsymbol k - 2(\boldsymbol k \cdot \boldsymbol n) \boldsymbol n\) where \(\boldsymbol n\) is the normal vector of the boundary.</p> <p>(ii) Diffuse reflection randomizes the reflection direction of phonons incident on the boundary, similar to how scattered phonons are treated.</p> <p>Specular reflection occurs when the boundary is very smooth (relative to the phonon wavelength), meaning the surface roughness of the boundary is much smaller than the phonon wavelength. Specular reflection does not randomize the phonon distribution, allowing phonons to maintain directional transport.</p> <p>Diffuse reflection occurs when the boundary roughness is comparable to or larger than the phonon wavelength. Diffuse reflection leads to an isotropic phonon distribution, reducing the efficiency of phonon heat transfer. In nanostructures, diffuse reflection enhances phonon-boundary scattering effects, significantly reducing the material’s effective thermal conductivity.</p> <h3 id="32-isothermal-boundary">3.2 Isothermal Boundary</h3> <p>Under isothermal boundary conditions at temperature \(T_b\), phonons incident on the boundary are completely absorbed. The boundary then re-emits phonons according to its own temperature \(T_b\), following the equilibrium distribution.</p> <p>The emitted heat flux per unit angular frequency can be expressed as:</p> \[q_{\omega,b}'' = \frac{1}{4} \sum_p \frac{D(\omega,p)v_g(\omega,p)\hbar\omega}{\exp\left(\frac{\hbar\omega}{k_B T_b}\right) - 1}\] <p>In deviational energy-based simulations, the difference in heat flux between the isothermal boundary and the reference equilibrium temperature \(T_\text{eq}\) must be considered. The corrected expression is given by:</p> \[q_{\omega,b}'' = \frac{1}{4} \sum_p D(\omega,p)v_g(\omega,p)\hbar\omega \cdot \bigg[\frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{\hbar\omega}{k_B T_b}\right) - 1} - \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{\hbar\omega}{k_B T_\text{eq}}\right) - 1} \bigg]\] <p>This formula provides the frequency distribution of emitted particles under isothermal boundary conditions. Specifically, it reflects the non-equilibrium phonon transport characteristics of the boundary at temperature \(T_b\), i.e., how the boundary absorbs and re-emits phonons based on the temperature difference.</p> <h3 id="33-periodic-boundary">3.3 Periodic Boundary</h3> <p>Periodic boundary conditions allow the simulation of a complete structure by considering only a single unit cell (period).</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-10 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/blog/peri_bond-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/blog/peri_bond-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/blog/peri_bond-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/blog/peri_bond.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>At the boundary, deviations in phonon distribution from local equilibrium are periodic and can be described by the following relations:</p> \[f_1^+ - f_{T_1}^\text{eq} = f_2^+ - f_{T_2}^\text{eq}\] \[f_1^- - f_{T_1}^\text{eq} = f_2^- - f_{T_2}^\text{eq}\] <p>Here, \(f_{T_1}^\text{eq}\) and \(f_{T_2}^\text{eq}\) denote the equilibrium distributions at temperatures \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), respectively.
