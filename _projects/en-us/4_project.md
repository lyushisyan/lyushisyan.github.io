### Theoretical Model of Thermophysical Properties of Nanowires

Nanowires have broad application prospects due to their unique and superior physical properties, especially in the field of micro-nanoelectronics, so studying the thermophysical properties of nanowires is necessary to predict the thermal operating conditions of microelectronic devices. A large number of studies have demonstrated the special thermophysical properties of nanowires [1, 2, 3]. In this work, several determinants affecting the thermophysical properties of nanostructures are considered: 1. Quantum confinement. We proposed a numerical algorithm [4] to solve the phonon dispersion relation in nanowires and determine the density of states of confined phonons in nanowires. Our calculations show that for diameters smaller than 20 nm, quantum confinement significantly affects the phonon state density. 2. Size effect. From a heat transfer perspective, when the feature size (nanowire diameter) is smaller than the phonon mean free path, scattering at the boundary has a decisive influence on the thermal conductivity. This phenomenon is called the size effect [5]. Boundary scattering will cause the phonon mean free path to be significantly reduced, thereby reducing the material thermal conductivity. 3. Rough surface. The surface of nanowires prepared by different methods has different roughness. Experiments have shown that the surface roughness of nanowires [3] is also an important factor affecting the thermophysical properties. To characterize the rough surface, the specular reflection parameter p and the root mean square roughness (rms) are introduced. By linking these parameters to specific experimental methods, more realistic mathematical models can be obtained.

The results show that the heat capacity behaves like a one-dimensional material at low temperatures and like a three-dimensional material at high temperatures. We developed a set of computational tools to evaluate and predict the thermal conductivity of nanowires, taking into account variables such as temperature, diameter, and root-mean-square roughness. It was compared and verified with the experimental data of thermal conductivity of silicon nanowires with diameters of 2.0nm, 6.14nm, 37nm, 56nm and 115nm in the temperature range of 100~350K [1,2,3].
